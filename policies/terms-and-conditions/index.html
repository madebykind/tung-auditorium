        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <h2 id="booking-terms-and-conditions">Booking Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>A booking fee of 8% will apply for all purchases made online or by telephone. It is the customer’s responsibility to check their tickets are correct after purchase, and to contact the box office immediately if there are any discrepancies. The Tung Auditorium cannot guarantee customer oversights can be rectified. Tickets are non-refundable unless an event is cancelled or rescheduled.</p>
        <p>The Tung Auditorium is not responsible for any lost/damaged/stolen tickets. Please take care of your tickets as we may not be able to issue duplicates. Every member of the audience must be in possession of a valid ticket due to safety regulations. Unless otherwise stated, performances are not likely to be suitable for children under five years of age. Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult.</p>
        <p>The Tung Auditorium reserves the right to provide alternative tickets at the Event should the staging of the Event so require. We reserve the right to change the listed programme/artist/timings without notice, however we will endeavour to notify customers of any significant change to a programme.</p>
        <p>Tickets purchased are for Customers’ own personal use and may not be transferred or resold to any other person for commercial gain. If we are made aware of the attempted resale of any tickets (or other breach of this term) The Tung Auditorium reserves the right to cancel the relevant tickets and refuse admission to Customers attempting to use that ticket. The Tung Auditorium will not be held responsible for any tickets purchased through an unrecognised ticket agent.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, tickets will be sent via email in a “Print at home” format which can also be shown on a mobile device to gain entry. Alternatively, physical tickets can also be collected from our onsite Box Office on the day of the event on production of the debit/credit card used at the time of booking. Tickets purchased at least 2 weeks in advance of an event can be posted for a £1 fee if desired.</p>
        <p>Additional terms and conditions may be in place for selected events, please the event page for specific terms and conditions.</p>
